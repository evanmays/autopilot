# Dark Forest Autopilot Plugin

If you know how to use the [projectsophon plugin build server](https://github.com/projectsophon/df-plugin-dev-server), and you know how to run a local deployment of dark forest using the [dark forest eth repo fork](https://github.com/evanmays/eth) and [dark forest client repo fork](https://github.com/evanmays/client), you can use this repo to test out your bot strategies. Currently, the only implemented strategy is pick a random planet, and pick the closest pirate-owned planet to attack.
